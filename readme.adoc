== Known Problem
- Negative integer (major type 1) is not fully implemented due to limitation of the integral Delphi type Int64. Hence, this code does not support negative integer lower than -2^63.

- Big Number and Negative Big Number (major type 6) is not supported.

- Encoding of semantic type and special type is not supported.
